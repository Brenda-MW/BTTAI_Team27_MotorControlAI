Team shared locations with BTTAI project
# Challenge Summary
Motor control is one of the core skillsets in robotics and electrification areas which are becoming more and more widely used in the industry. Currently, many industrial motor applications are driven by classical and robust control-based methods. In this project, you will implement Machine Learning-based motor control methods as an alternate pathway to overcome the real-world challenges.

# Project Goals and Outcome
## TEAMâ€™S OBJECTIVE
Conventional control approaches are effective when the system can be modelled predictably. It can be difficult to predict system nonlinearities due to motor parameter changes caused by aging and temperature variation.
 
Define application-specific pipeline: systems, data, controls and simulation
Study machine learning models for classification and regression tasks 
Deploy ML models in close-loop systems (software and hardware)  
* Use of reinforcement learning in motor control applications

## DESIRED OUTCOMES
Develop and evaluate workflows that demonstrates controller design and optimization using classical control theory and machine learning-based approaches.
