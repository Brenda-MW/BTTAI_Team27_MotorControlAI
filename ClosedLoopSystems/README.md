<h1>Closed-Loop Simulink Models</h1>

This project milestone focused on placing our models in a closed-loop system in Simulink that is fed a continuous signal generated from the vibration signals of a motor. Placing these signals in a dynamic simulation environment where the data input isn’t a flat vector but a time-stamped input timetable has several advantages. First, this allows us to see how the model reacts to signal data over a period of time. Importantly, this will allow us to measure the model’s latency and observe how long the model delays before reacting to a change in signal. Secondly, this allows us to compare the efficiency of several different models by observing how quickly they’re able to respond to signal changes. Lastly, the Simulink environment’s offered scope block allows us to observe both the signal’s value and the model’s prediction probabilities for each signal.
