<h3>Deep Learning</h3>
<hr>
This milestone of our project requires that we preprocess and perform feature extraction on our data so that we can utilize 
a nerual network model to predict our motor anomalies and faults. We focused on training and tuning recurrent neural networks
that are better suited to recognizing variations in our motor signals. We utilizied two main approaches: 
<ol>
  <li>Training a neural network from scratch</li>
  <li>Fine-tuning an existing neural network</li>
</ol>
