For the Hello World example, we will build a fault detection system from motor data avaiable from the "Experimental database for detecting and diagnosing rotor broken bar in a three-phase induction motor" https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/experimental-database-detecting-and-diagnosing-rotor-broken-bar-three-phase-induction. 

You can follow the steps in this published example on MathWorks' website and perform the exercises in MATLAB.

For the "hello world" project, you are asked to achieve: 
#1 Visualize the dataset information and work with large numerical dataset (non-image). 
#2 Process data and perform feature extraction
#3 Gain signal processing knowledge from pre-processing the dataset entries (time domain and spectrum domain)
#4 Select models to fit the problem and evaluate their performance
#5 Deploy the trained model and evaluate the performance in the "wild"

The Diagnostic Feature Design and the Classification Learner app mentioned in the example packaged many steps in a user friendly way. I suggest you develop code to perform these tasks to identify the technical details.
